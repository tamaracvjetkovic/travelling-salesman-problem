# Travelling Salesman Problem üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

TSP problem solution using genetic algorithm.

---

This was a university project, done in the team of two, for the course "Nonlinear Programming and Evolutionary Algorithms", taken in the 3rd semester of the Software Engineering and Information Technologies program.

The ``goal`` of the project was to:
- apply the acquired knowledge in evolutionary algorithms,
- solve the TSP problem optimally using a genetic algorithm
#
Technologies used: 
- ``Python``
#
Date: January, 2024.

# How does it work? ‚ùì
- loads the coordinates of cities from a file and stores them in a dictionary,
- generates the **initial population** (a set of random city route),
- after that, each route‚Äôs total distance is calculated using Euclidean distance and then ranked (**fitness evaluation**),
- generate new populations using:
  - ``selection`` ‚Äì elitism and roulette wheel to choose parents,
  - ``crossover`` ‚Äì creates children by combining genes from two parents,
  - ``mutation`` ‚Äì swaps genes in routes randomly to maintain diversity
- the program stops when the best distance doesn‚Äôt improve for 30 iterations (**convergence**).
